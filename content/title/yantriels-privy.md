Yantriel lives on a small pig farm,
grieving the loss of his wife,
trying to make a good life for his two daughters.

Then,
on a midsummer day,
an endless mass of frogs begins to ooze out of Yantriel’s outhouse.

Not just ordinary frogs.
These frogs know things.

Now the frogs set their sights
on the only thing Yantriel ever cared about...

His family.

A creepy fantasy short story from
